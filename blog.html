					<h>Hi! everyone. I am Bimal Khatri and welcome to my blog page.</h><br/>
					<p>This blog page is all about the technology and how it has and is affecting my life and normal people. Technology is not a new topic to us. When I use the term "technology" then I know you all have thought about mobile phones and computers or any other electrical devices. Yes, you are right. They are also the outcomes of technology. But have you wondered what actually is technology? Technology is the combination of various science process and other projects and method to make our task easier and more convenient.<span id="threeDots">...</span><span id="hidden">
 					<br/><br/>At first, we are going to see the affect of technology in normal people life. As we know everything in the world has both good and bad part. Likewise, technology has also the good and bad affect in people life. Some people use technology to do their task and some are against the technology and they like to do their task by themselves independent of the machine. A human from the earth reaching the surface of moon and outside of the earth would not be possible if there was no technology. Today, we cannot find the person who does not use any kind of technology. Talking about technology, when the person starts using technology then s/he becomes addicted using it. People cannot do anything nowadays without mobile phone which is also a technology. All of their data and information is stored in the mobile phone even their contact numbers. People are so dependent of their mobile that if they are in a new place and their mobile is lost then they cannot return to their home. Communication skill between two people 				or family member is slowly decreasing with the increasement of using technology. People are so busy that they barely talk to their family member and also can't give a little bit time to their family. In this way technology has both positive and negative affect in people life.<br/><br/>
 					Now, talking about me I think I have more positive affect of technology than the negative affect. I am not saying Technology does not have any negative affect in my life. Without technology I wouldn't have reached this position where I am now. Technology has help me a lot to achieve the thing that I have dreamed of. I always want to join the field of computer and technology. Without technology it would not have been possible. Due to help of google map I was able to visit different places of Kathmandu by myself when I visited Kathmandu for the first time. I am able to make my friend all over the world. Currently I have friends from India, Indonesia, china, USA, UK and Germany. Different learning platform like YouTube, Udemy has helped me a lot to get extra information related my college course. I am able to talk with my relatives who live inside or outside of Nepal. Also, it is technology that have connected you and me. You are able to read my blog because of technology. So, there are lots of things that 					makes me to think that technology have helped me a lot.<br/><br/>
					Also, talking the negative aspect of technology there is a recent incident that happened with my mother. My mother was using her phone while boiling milk in the kitchen. She was so focused in her mobile that she forgets she is boiling the milk. After some minutes me and my sister realized burnt-smell coming from the milk.  Then I turn off the gas and scolded mom to be careful. You may not find this incident that much serious but what may have happened if me and my sister weren't home. This incident may happen in your house too.<br/><br/>
					So, we should use and make a habit of using technology in such a way that It will helps us and benefit us. But we should not be fully addicted to it. We should use technology in a way that it will never cause damage to us and our personal life.</p></span>
